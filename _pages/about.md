* I am a 2nd year master student at CSE Department, [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). 
My advisor is [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/).

* My research interest is building intelligent systems that can actively interact with the environment, with the ability of perception, reasoning and generalization. 
My current research mainly focuses on understanding human-environment interactions.

* I am also an amateur Chinese Calligrapher, my previous graduation exhibition is [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7ERydW3i3iGsVcMOR13nzQ).
