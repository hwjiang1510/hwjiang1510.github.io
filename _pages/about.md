* I am now a second-year master student at CSE Department, [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). 
My advisor is [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/).

* I received my B.E. from EE Department, [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019, where I worked with [Prof. Qin Zou](https://sites.google.com/site/qinzoucn/).

* I was a research intern at Detection Group, [MEGVII](https://megvii.com/en). I was also a research assistant at UCLA, worked with [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

* I aim to build intelligent systems that can actively interact with the enviornment, with the ability of perception, reasoning and generalization. 
My current research mainly focuses on understanding human-enviornment interactions.
